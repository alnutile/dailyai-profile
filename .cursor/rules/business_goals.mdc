# Solutions examples and cards

This is an older site done in VITE
We typically use next

in this case I want to use supabase and render the page /solutions (a new page)

and that will query the supabase table 

when you are done we will have a new page using the same style (even though I like daisyui this stie is already setup a certain why

and that page will have full width cards to show the following data (as seen in the image)

@cards.png 

the database scheme is 
create table public.usecases (
  "Rough Draft" text null,
  "Quote" jsonb null,
  "If You Are" text null,
  "Source" text null,
  "URL" text null,
  "Time_Saved" text null,
  "Monthly_Cost" text null,
  "Ai" text null,
  "Automation Tools" text null,
  id uuid not null default gen_random_uuid (),
  verified_at timestamp without time zone null,
  valid booll null,
  qr_code_url text null,
  constraint usecases_pkey primary key (id),
  constraint usecases_id_key unique (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;

and the card is made up of each field

here are the fields you care about
## Quote
we saved 10 hours weekly using ai and automation to summarize meeting notes
- Smalltown City Clerk, [towname.gov]

## If You Are
Are you writing grants?

## Time Saved and other data (if null add n/a)
Time_Saved
Monthly_Cost
Ai 
Automation Tools

The QR Code I will be null for now but you can get it from the column qr_code_url


And the url under it is marketing so it is just always taht
